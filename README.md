# nodejs_bp
A small node.js project boilerplate

## Introduction
While fallowing the book [Building APIs with Node.js](http://www.apress.com/la/book/9781484224410#otherversion=9781484224427) I found some important errors when implementing the samples. That book in mention is short but provide us a with a whole strategy and good practices to build node.js applications based on REST APIs.
I worked out all those errors and updated the dependencies as you can see in the `package.json` file.

## A boilerplate

My purpose is to use this project as a boiler plate for my small and medium node.js projects. At the 
moment I'm using sequelize.js, so that means the databases supported are: MySql, PostgreSQL, Sqlite and
MS SqlServer, but this code were tested just in PostgreSQL 9.x.

This is my boilerplate, not intended as a open source licenced product at all.

## If you want to try it

1. Install `Node.js`

2. Install `git`

3. run the next commands form the os command line

```
git clone https://github.com/jpsalvadorm63/nodejs_bp.git
cd nodejs_bp
npm install
```

*All of this allways on your own risk*
