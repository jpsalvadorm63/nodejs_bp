# nodejs_bp
A small node.js project boilerplate

## Introduction
While fallowing the book [Building APIs with Node.js](http://www.apress.com/la/book/9781484224410#otherversion=9781484224427) I found some important errors when implementing the samples. That book in mention is short but provide us a with a whole strategy and good practices to build node.js applications based on REST APIs.
I worked out all those errors and updated the dependencies as you can see in the `package.json` file.

## A boilerplate

My purpose is to use this project as a boiler plate for small and medium node.js projects.
